Notes to eleborate on:

Challange on how to store sequentiual changes in heading and coordinates when executing multiple commands
Could add in 55 string from test input in the future but can be removed as part of code before coordinates and heading are processed
Can update move and turn functions to throw errors if x, y coordinates exceed the value of 5 - as is 5x5 grid and ensure rovers stay on plateau
Security considerations - functions should be behind authentication and authorisation mechanisims so only authorised personel can send commands to the rovers
